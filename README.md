## what is vim?
Vim is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text, and is the most popular text editor in Linux now.

Vim is a successor to vi which is a text editor from the early days of Unix. It became quite popular and made its way into the Single Unix Specification (SUS) and POSIX, but wasn't freely available until 2002. Vim means vi improved, as the name suggest it adds lots of functions to the original vi interface.

#### Vim adds onto those features. Here are a some of the extended vim features:

* Vim has been ported to a much wider range of OS's than vi.
* Vim includes support (syntax highlighting, code folding, etc) for several popular programming languages (C/C++, Python, Perl, shell, etc).
* Vim integrates with cscope.
* Vim can be used to edit files using network protocols like SSH and HTTP.
* Vim includes multilevel undo/redo.
* Vim allows the screen to be split for editing multiple files.
* Vim can edit files inside a compressed archive (gzip, zip, tar, etc).
* Vim includes a built in diff for comparing files (vimdiff).
* Vim includes support for plugins, and finer control over config and startup files.
* Vim can be scripted with vimscript, or with an external scripting language (e.g. python, perl, shell).
