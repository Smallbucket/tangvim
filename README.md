## What is vim?
Vim is a highly configurable text editor for efficiently creating and changing any kind of text, now is the most popular text editor in Linux.

Vim (/vɪm/ a contraction of <strong>Vi IMproved</strong>) is a clone, with additions, of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. It was written by Bram Moolenaar based on source for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and first released publicly in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is free and open-source software and is released under a license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The license is compatible with the GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies "under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version".

Vim is a successor to vi which is a text editor from the early days of Unix. It became quite popular and made its way into the Single Unix Specification (SUS) and POSIX, but wasn't freely available until 2002. Vim means vi improved, as the name suggest it adds lots of functions to the original vi interface.

Vim adds onto those features. Here are a some of the extended vim features:
* Vim has been ported to a much wider range of OS's than vi.
* Vim includes support (syntax highlighting, code folding, etc) for several popular programming languages (C/C++, Python, Perl, shell, etc).
* Vim integrates with cscope.
* Vim can be used to edit files using network protocols like SSH and HTTP.
* Vim includes multilevel undo/redo.
* Vim allows the screen to be split for editing multiple files.
* Vim can edit files inside a compressed archive (gzip, zip, tar, etc).
* Vim includes a built in diff for comparing files (vimdiff).
* Vim includes support for plugins, and finer control over config and startup files.
* Vim can be scripted with vimscript, or with an external scripting language (e.g. python, perl, shell).

Although it was originally released for the Amiga, Vim has since been developed to be cross-platform, supporting many other platforms. In 2006, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal readers; in 2015 the Stack Overflow developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor, and the fifth most popular development environment in 2018.

## History
Bram Moolenaar began working on Vim for the Amiga computer in 1988. Moolenaar first publicly released Vim (v1.14) in 1991. Vim was based on an earlier editor, Stevie, for the Atari ST, created by Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews, and G.R. (Fred) Walter.

The name "Vim" is an acronym for "Vi IMproved" because Vim is an extended version of the vi editor, with many additional features designed to be helpful in editing program source code. Originally, the acronym stood for "Vi IMitation", but that was changed with the release of Vim 2.0 in December 1993. A later comment states that the reason for changing the name was that Vim's feature set surpassed that of vi.

## Help
Vim has a built-in tutorial for beginners (accessible through the `vimtutor` command). There is also the Vim Users' Manual that details Vim's features and a FAQ. This manual can be read from within Vim, or found online.[30][31]

Vim also has a built-in help facility (using the :help command) that allows users to query and navigate through commands and features.
